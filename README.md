Create a task list. A user is presented with the text below. 
Let them select an option to list all of their tasks, add a task to their list, delete a task, or quit the program.
 Make each option a different function in your program. Do <strong>NOT</strong> use Google. Do <strong>NOT</strong> use other students.
  Try to do this on your own.

```
Congratulations! You're running [YOUR NAME]'s Task List program.

What would you like to do next?

2. Add a task to the list.
3. Delete a task.
0. To quit the program
```

#### Extra Credit. Save the user's list in a text file. When the program is run again, input that text file so their task list is not lost.
